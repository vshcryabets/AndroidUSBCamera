**Purpose of this project:** Prepare an easy-to-use library for Android applications that allows:
1. Getting video from UVC devices.
1. Getting audio from UAC devices.

## Permissions

Android now often implicitly requires the CAMERA permission in addition to the explicit USB permission, especially when your app's targetSdkVersion is 28 or higher.
